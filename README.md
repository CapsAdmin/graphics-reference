I'm not a professional photographer but I'll probably learn if I keep this up.

All photos are taken in Norway near Oslo unless stated otherwise. No editing except cropping and maybe resizing is done.

TODO:
    Get a tripod as soon as possible
    Maybe provide lighting info and overall be more consistent
