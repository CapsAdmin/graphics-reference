I'm not a professional photographer but I'll probably learn if I keep this up. At the moment I'm just noobing about with auto mode.

All photos are taken in Norway near Oslo unless stated otherwise. No editing except cropping and maybe resizing is done.

TODO:
- Get a tripod as soon as possible
- Maybe provide lighting info and overall be more consistent
